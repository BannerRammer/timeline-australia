          Before Federation in Australia, there were six colonies of Australia. New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. If you were travelling to another colony, you had to have a immigration pass, a passport and all the things you need just like going to another country. This caused major issues. All the colonies had different armies, railroads, roads and everything really. However this all change and in the late 1880s, a guy named Henry Parkes had an idea of uniting every colony together to form one nation. So he set into action and started to protest about Federation. This also led to him saying his famous speech Tenterfield Oration. More and more people got onto the idea in the early 1890s and it even spread to the other colonies like Victoria. After this, referendums started whether or not federation should or should not happen. This has been going on for 10 years. More and more people liked the idea of federation so propaganda posters started to show up. Then, in the middle of 1890s. All the colonies including New Zealand (which stepped out of the federation idea) came together to make a draft for the constitution. They took parts from American and Great Britain and in 1901, their constitution became official. After years and years of referendums and propaganda. In 1900, the constitution went to the Queen in London and she liked the idea of federation. So on the 1st of January. 1901. Federation was appointed onto Australia uniting all colonies as one and transforming them into states.

        During making the constitution, all the premiers of the colonies came together and discussed which city should be the capital. Some people think Sydney should be the capital because it was the first city to be discovered on the first fleet. Some say Melbourne because it is revolutionary. But they ended up making a territory called the ACT which is short for Australian Capital Territory.
