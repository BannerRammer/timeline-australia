Hello there, welcome to this website. This website is where you can find out the history about Australia. Here, you can find a timeline of significant events that happened in Australia in a certain period of time like the Eureka Stockade in the Gold Rush period in Australia. Here I split these significant events into 5 periods of time. These are the things that happened before British Settlement, Things that happened during colonization, things that happened during the Gold Rush, things that happened in the 20th Century and the things that happened in the 21st Century.

Anyways, now I want to talk about a bit of this website's making. So yeah, strap in for some boring stuff. Anyways, so this website is made using HTML, an easy coding language used to make websites, pop ups, and games. I programmed this website in a famous programming software called Sublime Text, a text editor where you can code in. In supports all different types of coding languages such as C# or Javascript. I also used a programming language called CSS. It's a programming language used to style websites like this one. It's linked to HTML so that means when I program with CSS, It goes straight to my HTML file which can show the CSS styling on the page. Yes, I know, this is a bit complicated but you will get it wants you research about coding in HTML and CSS.

Oh yes, I forgot, my name is Lorenzo and I created this website, I didn't use Wix or Weebly, I used pure CSS and HTML. This is why it looks like a website that came from the 90s. Hey, It's hard to code a full website that is full of information. Oh hey, because this page won't be filled up with text. Let's fill it up with weird pictures shall we.
