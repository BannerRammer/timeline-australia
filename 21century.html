  Before Federation, only women around South Australia and Western Australia had women's rights however the other states wanted to have women's rights. So after after the Parliament was made, women protested for women's rights to vote and in 1902, an act had passed just so that women over the age of 21 can vote. This was a first in the world. However, women over the age of 21 were allowed to vote federal elections, not local or state elections. So during the 1890s and 1920s, women protested and the states had allowed women to vote state and local elections as well but at different times.

          On April 15th, 1915, Australian and New Zealand forces (aka ANZACS) attacked Gallipoli, a beach in modern day Turkey to reach the capital, Constantinople to get rid of the Ottomon Empire from joining the war. However, they landed on the wrong beach and the Ottomons won the battle in late 1915 and early 1916. More than 100000 ANZACS lost their lives.
